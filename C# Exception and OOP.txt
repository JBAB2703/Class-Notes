Exceptions p.71


-try catch block

    try {...} // Must have
    catch (Exception Ex) {...} // Must have
    finally {...} // Optional

-A sort of catch all for handling exceptions is to put it in the main

-Not handling exceptions will cause your program to "blow up"
-Its good practice that when your using methods from the Library to use Intellicense to try and identify what
 possible Exceptions you might have happen.

 Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
    3 tenets of OOP 
        1. Encapsulation 
            Has to do with the creation of classes
                Note: 2 thing that have to go into a class - 1. Properties and 2. methods
            Encapsulation is the creation of an object that takes properties and methods and can be blocked off by
            the rest of the world. 
        
        2. Inheritance
            Its the ability to create a new object by using a current object and then specifying what is different.

        3. Polymorphism
            objects that can change into other things

        *4. Composition
                proponents of composition think that this should replace Inheritance
