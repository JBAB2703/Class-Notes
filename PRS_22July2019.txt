Creating tables in SQL for the Capstone project
Will send the detail information in Slack
We will create a PRS (Purchase Request System)
    5 Tables that will be created
        -Tables
            -User
            -Vendor (Company)
            -Product
            -Request
            -Request Line (Many to Many) 
                -Based on the task given to us by Greg
                this will deal with Constraints

View
    -it is a query stored in the database with a given name
    which allows you to treat it like a table when you do a select
    -again, create once and alter everytime after that
