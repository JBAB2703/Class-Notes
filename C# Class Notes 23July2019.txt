Statements
    Case Sensitive p.39
        cat, Cat, and CAT are all different
    Statement Blocks
        is a block of statments that are within a set of curly Statements
    Statement terminator p. 40
        must be terminated with a semicolon(;)
        *Exception - almost never put a semicolon after a closing curly bracket
    Ignores Whitespace
    
    Keywords pg.41
        Cant use these words for object names or variables
    Assignments pg.41
        This is when you take a value from somewhere and store it in a variables
            Example: a = 1; (This is an assignement statement or it is sometimes called a "move statement")
                it evaluates everything on the right side and then copies it over into the variables
                Print(a); which means to print the value that the variable has in it
            
                Think of it this way: 
                    do everything you need to do on the right side of the equal sign and then copy it over to the left side

    Equality pg.42
        Example: While(i==10) 
            A double equal sign is a check for Equality

    Statically Typed
        a language that requires the developer to declare a variable with a specific type

    Using Statement

        Code example is under MyFirstConsoleProject

            using System;

            namespace MyFirstConsoleProject {
                    Class Program {
                        static void Main(string[] args) {
                            Console.WriteLine("Hello Word!");
                        }
                    }
            }        
                
        System is a library and the word "using" allows me to use it

        Example:
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!")

                Console is a class
                WriteLine is a method or a (function)
                
                Fullname of this could look like
                System.Console.WriteLine
                System is in the library
                Console is the class
                WriteLine is the method or a (function)

    Contents of a Class 
            Note: Things tend to be modeled as classes
                  Everything is C# is a class

        1 Properties (variables) are the data that the class holds
        2 Methods (Functions) pieces of executable code that i can call that are part of the class
    

    Operators
        +, -, *, /

        % (modulus)
        a % b = remainder a/b
        7 % 2 = 7 / 2 = 3 * 2 = 6 = 1
