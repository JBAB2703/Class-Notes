Writing a program (2 steps)
    1. Make it Functional (or make it work!!!)
    2. Make it Elegant!
        a. Make it fast
        b. Make it extensible 
        c. Make the code modifyable (don't make it cryptic)

Enumerations p.50
    Is a way to define a particular set of values a variable is allowed to have basically they are new types

    Example: enum DaysOfTheWeek {Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday}
                                   (0)     (1)     (3)         (4)     (5)      (6)     (7)

                OLD Way:
                if(DOW == 3)
                Console.WriteLine("Thursday")

    Example:
        Better way to do our example of "class Student Status"

        enum StudentStatus
            {Past, Current, Future};

Nullable value types p.50

Interfaces p.50


Static p.52
    Static Variables
    Static Methods can only access are static variables (properties)


Shorter way of doing:
index = index + 1;
index +=1; Note: This is the same as above, just shorter
index++; Note: This is the same as both of the ones above, just shorter again. Why because programmers like things to be shortened any chance they get
